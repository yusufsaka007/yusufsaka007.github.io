# How I Completed the CompTIA Trifecta – And What You Should Know Before You Try

I finally did it—I passed Security+ and wrapped up the CompTIA trifecta (A+, Network+, and Security+). It’s been a grind with a long 50 days, but a rewarding one. If you’re thinking about going down the same path, or already on your way, I want to share a few things I wish I knew when I started. This isn’t going to be one of those super polished, corporate-sounding guides. Just real talk on what to expect, what to study, and how to keep your head straight while doing it.

I'm not here to offer you some magic potion that dumps all the exam knowledge into your brain overnight. Sadly, I don’t have that kind of MMO RPG loot. What I do have, though, is a plan—something that works if you're willing to put in the time and effort. No shortcuts, just real steps that can actually get you across the finish line.

## Why Take CompTIA Exams Anyway

If you're just getting into IT or cybersecurity, CompTIA certifications are one of the best places to start. They cover a wide range of foundational topics that you'll keep building on throughout your career. A+, Network+, and Security+ might not turn you into an 1337 hacker or sysadmin overnight, but they’ll give you the groundwork you need to actually understand what’s going on in the field. And employers take them seriously—especially for entry-level roles. That said, don’t mistake “entry-level” for “easy.” These exams still demand time, focus, and a solid grasp of the material if you want to pass without guessing your way through. Learning is valuable and fun, that is definetly true. But if you want to get into the professional side of the things, certificates -if chosen correctly- are a great way to prove your knowledge. That being said, let’s talk about how to actually get those certs up on your wall.

## Materials I used

Before diving into the materials I used, there’s something important you should keep in mind: everyone has their own way of learning—and so do I. What I’m offering here isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. Instead, waht I give you is bunch of options you can pick from based on what fits your learning style best.

CompTIA provides official exam objectives for each of their certifications. You can grab them from this link (just enter your email and they'll send you a copy):  
**[Insert link to exam objectives here]**

Keep these objectives close—they’re basically your blueprint for passing. Print them out, save them as a PDF, whatever works for you. These aren’t just checklists—they’re *the* checklist. Personally, I loaded them onto my tablet and highlighted each topic as I went. It helped me stay organized and made sure I didn’t accidentally skip over anything important.

While the exam objectives tell you *what* to study, you’ll still need a solid course to actually understand the material. That’s where Professor Messer comes in. I passed all of my CompTIA exams thanks to his free YouTube courses—the quality is so high it almost feels illegal. If the exam objectives are your bible, Professor Messer is the preacher walking you through it, line by line.

His videos are structured to follow the objectives step by step, which makes it easy to track your progress and stay on target. It’s honestly one of the most underrated resources out there—and the fact that it’s completely free still blows my mind.

Here are the links to his latest playlists:

- [CompTIA A+ 220-1101](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnnes8ZGI-OBlKEukHCX46N8)  
- [CompTIA A+ 220-1102](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnna96gzhJrzkii4hH_mgW4b)  
- [CompTIA Network+ N10-009](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnl_tQe3kvnmeMid0mjF8Le8)  
- [CompTIA Security+ SY0-701](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnl4QDVqK-hOnoqcSKEIDDuv)

While Professor Messer’s playlists are more than enough to get you through the exams, I still recommend using at least one additional resource to help reinforce the concepts. Personally, I used the **All-In-One Network+** book by Mike Meyers and Scott Jernigan. Even though it was written for the older N10-008 version, it still covered almost everything I needed for the N10-009 exam. When I started studying for Network+, I didn’t just want to pass—I wanted to actually *understand* the material—and this book helped a lot with that. 

NetworkChuck has a CCNA course—uncompleted for a reason—on YouTube that I highly recommend, especially if you have little to no networking background. He explains concepts in a way that’s incredibly beginner-friendly, and his enthusiasm makes it way more engaging than your average lecture. Honestly, it's such an privilige to access such courses with great storytelling for free .

This might sound like overkill, but I also recommend trying out some simulated labs using Cisco’s Packet Tracer. It’s super easy to set up, and there are tons of pre-made simulations ready to go. It’s especially helpful when you're learning how routers and switches work, how DHCP operates, or when you're trying to really understand the OSI model. Getting hands-on—even in a simulated environment—makes a big difference.

For Security+, I read **Security+ Get Certified Get Ahead** by Darril Gibson and Joe Shelley. I have to say, it was a solid secondary resource that helped me feel more prepared for the exam.

I know some people also use Jason Dion’s courses on Udemy, but let’s be real—not everyone wants to pay extra, especially with how expensive the exams already are. If you’re on a budget, stick with Professor Messer, but if you want to minimize your chances of failing, combining multiple resources is definitely worth considering.

I also used ChatGPT and [PowerCert Animated Videos](https://www.youtube.com/@PowerCertAnimatedVideos) on YouTube. Both are great for filling in gaps and giving you different angles on the topics with real world examples.
